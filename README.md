## Dataset

> This data set includes information about 14646 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The data originally contain 16 charateristics for each individual rides
* duration_sec
* start_time
* end_time
* end_time
* start_station_id
* start_station_name
* start_station_latitude 
* start_station_longitude
* end_station_id
* end_station_name
* end_station_latitude
* end_station_longitude
* bike_id, 
* user_type
* member_birth_year
* member_gender
* bike_share_for_all_trip 



## Summary of Findings

> * `Market St at 10th St` and `San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St) ` were the most common start stations.
> * 91.78% of users of this system were subsriber
> * 74.75% of the riders were males, 23.19% were female and 2.06% are other genders
> * The most usage during the morning was around the hours of 8-9am, and in the afternoon was around the hours of 5-6pm. Bikes were most used around 5pm
> * A large portion of riders were less than 40. Riders of age 31 were the most.
> * Distance traveled and duration of rides are morderately correlated with the most number of rides taking less than 20mins and traveled less than 4km with most of these members being of ages less than 40
> * Most Distance Traveled and Trip Duration is very similar across each genders and, also similar for each user types.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Most Distance Traveled and Trip Duration is very similar across  each genders and, also similar for each user types. This shows that gender and user type doesn't really have much effect trip duration and distance traveled
> Age-wise it seem over 60 didn't travel pass some minutes or distance. This shows that to some extent age can affects distance traveled and trip duratance.
